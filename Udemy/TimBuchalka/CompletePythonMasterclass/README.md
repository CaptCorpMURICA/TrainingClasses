Data analytics has many avenues to pursue. You could specialize in model development or focus on generating insights to direct the business to the next level. I prefer to specialize on transforming the raw feeds into a usable dataset that can be leveraged by the modelers and analysts. Primarily, my tools of choice are SQL and Bash, but it is critical to continue to learn new languages and techniques to take your ETL to the next level.

Before enrolling in this course, I had experience in several object-oriented languages, including Java and C++. Additionally, I have used R, Python, and SAS as a data scientist. This course is to help learn some of the object-oriented functions available with Python 3.

My goal is to advance my understanding of Python 3 to be leveraged in the data engineering focus of analytics. These lessons will help me develop ETL of new data sources and harden existing processes for improved efficiency and reliability.
