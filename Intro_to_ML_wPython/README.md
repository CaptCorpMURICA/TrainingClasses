# Intro to Machine Learning with Python  

**Objective:** Would you like to be able to predict the future? Machine Learning is a branch of AI that promotes systems decision making by identifying patterns in data with minimal human intervention. Python is an open source codebase that easily allows you to tap into many open source libraries. This class will focus on scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn and a few others. With this Python learning pod you will be able to identify which algorithms to use to classify your data or run predictive models based on whether you need to do supervised or unsupervised learning.   

**Outline:** Seven (7) classes with both Activity modules to review in class and guided (or blank template) Experiment modules to run outside of class.  
Module 1: Basics  
Module 2: Intro to Modeling - Train Test Split, Data Exploration  
Module 3: Supervised Learning 1 - Classification and Regression Models  
Module 4: Supervised Learning 2 - Decision Trees, Random Forest, GBM, Neural Networks  
Module 5: Unsupervised Learning 1 - Preprocessing, PCA, Feature Extraction  
Module 6: Unsupervised Learning 2 - Clustering  
Module 7: Feature Engineering and Model Comparison
